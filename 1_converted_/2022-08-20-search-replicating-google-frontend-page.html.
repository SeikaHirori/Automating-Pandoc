style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now,
reflecting on my first Front-end project from CS50w: whoa, Front-end
(HTML and CSS) could be tackled from many different angles than I
expected. For the back-end, it is the same case where the steps could
vary BUT the inputs and outputs are the same. With the front-end, my
observation so far is that you could use different tools to achieve
similar results… BUT, you can now see how it is being visually
presented. Plus, it seems like depending on the approach used, another
section of code could influence a pre-existing section. Some approaches
are good for one situation, but it might be bad when you need to scale
out/ add extra code for a certain outcome. I did not realize that
front-end could be this dynamic, and it intrigues me. </span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For
the project, attempting to emulate the three search pages was not too
bad as there were not too many visual components.. The toughest visual
part was searching the proper terms to achieve the desired visual
output. For example, it was difficult figuring out how to align multiple
elements/ components to the center of the web page. In this context, the
Google logo, any subtext [i.e.: Images/ Advanced], search bar(s),
“Search” action button, and “I’m Feeling Lucky” action
button.</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">From
the… logic side (not sure the proper term), it was interesting to see
how Google used “role” values in the form element to trigger their
respective results [i.e. general search, images-only, and the various
criterias for advance search]. For the first step of the examination/
research phase, I tried to delete as much of the google results as
possible until the desired output was no longer available. Afterwards, I
tried to individually delete small sections of string within “/’ to see
which parts were crucial. Lastly, I looked into how these strings were
implemented within each “input” element.</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Overall,
this project was a great introduction to front-end for me. My previous
attempts with front-end were not successful, but the programming
experience and knowledge I obtained when entering this project made this
process more bearable. There are some minor things that could be
adjusted and added, but the important thing is that I have the knowledge
of WHAT I should look for when using Google and looking at various
StackOverFlow and docs.</span></p>

am excited to learn and apply the various things from this course for my
personal project and future endeavor! </span></p>
