O yeah… PWAs exist… and what’s this? Full-stack elements fulfills my
needs for personal projects? I am interested :3</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I
did not expect to set my sights on Full-Stack Development at all. I
thoroughly enjoyed coding back-end via Python and Java, but my previous
attempts to get into web-related stuff put me off it. Before committing
to learning the basics with the </span><a

I tried out some web introduction courses via </span><a

Unfortunately, both of these things were difficult to understand. It
also did not help that I was not interested in the Front-end aspects at
the time. Even before starting these web intro courses, a mate
introduced me to Python long ago and the aspect of “lul you can make 2+2
= 4” was so fascinating to me. As a result, the web intro courses did
not fit my learning desires at the time. After completing the Java
course, I attempted to get into web by using </span><a

style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">
for an ill-prepared personal project. Unfortunately, I was very confused
as I had no idea what was happening (despite reading the
documentation).</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fast
forward to a few weeks ago. I wrote the backend with Python for my
personal project (</span><a href="https://github.com/WaToArt/miru"
style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span
style="color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">miru</span></a><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">).
I had an issue: “... so how do I display information to the user?“. My
initial thought was to develop STRICTLY for one platform. Next, I
narrowed it down to mobile devices as it would be the most accessible
device for myself. Finally, Android seemed to be the best option as I
could test on an older device OR through a Virtual Machine (VM).
HOWEVER, I quickly realized that the learning curve and period was too
drastic for my liking on the available tools for Python.</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Then,
two things hit me. First, I randomly had the thought of “o, it would be
nice to have a personal site to display links to my projects on Github,
blog posts, and so on…“ a while back. For a brief period, I lightly went
through </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"

style="color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">MDN’s
web doc</span></a><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">
before I shifted focus elsewhere. Second, it hit me again when I used a
few Progressive Web Apps (PWA) on my phone and desktop: “... Oh yeah,
PWA exists! :3”. This stemmed from a media site and </span><a
href="https://devdocs.io/offline"
style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span
style="color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">DevDocs.io</span></a><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">
being PWAs. The latter especially reintroduced AND showed me that PWAs
made progress to where it can download and contain offline data. When I
tried PWAs on Android in 2018, it amazed me about its functionality… but
I quickly forgot about it since the performance was sluggish compared to
using the app’s native version. This led me to learning about web
frameworks for Python, which was Django.</span></p>

</p>
<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now,
I tried to follow Django’s tutorial docs BUT I needed supplemental
material. I realized that CS50w (Web Development) uses Django for the
course. This was perfect as the course provided a great explanation of
how web development works and the synergy between front-end and
back-end.</span></p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To
conclude: Did I expect to dive in the world of Full-Stack? NOPEEE, but
aspect seems like the best option for where I am at in my journey. I
could try to focus on developing a platform-exclusive app, but I find
that insufficient AND unaligned my vision of accessibility. Anyhow,
let’s get it.</span></p>
